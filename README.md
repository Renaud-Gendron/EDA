# Exploratory Data Analysis with the Student Performance Dataset

For this project, I used the Student Performance Dataset to determine if there is a relationship between different scores (dependant variable) and different features (for example gender). I used two different programming languages for this project: R and Python. Here are the links for the two different versions of this project:
